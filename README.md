# Koe
Koe is yet another voice connection library for [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari), and is designed to work specifically with my bots. If you find it useful, be my guest.

## Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tairabiteru/koe
```

## FAQ
- **Why'd you write your own?** - Because I like knowing how things work.
- **Where's the documentation?** - I didn't write it lol. On a more serious note, I haven't really written it yet because this library's still in active development. It exists not out of necessity, but because I like things to work a very particular way. If you can root through the source code and make it work for you, go right ahead. But if you're looking for an easy drop-in solution with examples...this ain't it, chief.
- **What's the name mean?** - Following Hikari's own naming scheme, "koe", 声,  (koh-ay) is the Japanese word for "voice."
