# Koe
Koe is yet another voice connection library for [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari), and is designed to work specifically with my bots. If you find it useful, be my guest.

## FAQ
- **Why'd you write your own?** - Because I like knowing how things work.
- **What's the name mean?** - Following Hikari's own naming scheme, "koe", 声,  (koh-ay) is the Japanese word for "voice."
